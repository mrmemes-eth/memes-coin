## MemesCoin

A modern (opinionated) meme coin template suitable for forking to create your own.

## Features

1. great developer experience using Foundry tooling
2. lightweight footprint due to using Solid-State Solidity libraries
3. diamond pattern storage, if you care about that sort of thing

## What's Next?

If there's community interest, it'd be easy to make this more configurable so
forking isn't necessary and you can generate new coins from a command line. Very
open to pull requests and issues describing feature requests.
